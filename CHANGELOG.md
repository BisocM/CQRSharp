# Changelog

All notable changes to CQRSharp are documented here. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [3.0.0]

### Breaking changes

- **Namespace flatten.** The redundant `Data` segment was removed from the `CQRSharp.Abstractions` namespaces
  (e.g. `CQRSharp.Abstractions.Data.Interfaces.Markers.Command` → `CQRSharp.Abstractions.Interfaces.Markers.Command`).
  Update `using` directives accordingly.
- **Pipeline behavior namespaces.** `CQRSharp.Pipelines.Types.*` → `CQRSharp.Pipelines.Behaviors.*`.
- **Outbox contract.** `IOutboxStore` now uses claim-based delivery: `GetPendingAsync` atomically claims due messages
  (`Pending` → `InProgress`), a new `IncrementAttemptAsync` records failed attempts durably, and `OutboxMessage`
  gained `AttemptCount`/`NextRetryAt` and renamed `Error` to `LastError`. Custom stores must implement the new member.
- **Opt-in retries.** Automatic retries by the resilience behavior now require requests to implement the new
  `IRetryableRequest` marker. Non-idempotent requests are no longer retried by default. Caller cancellation and
  timeouts are never retried.
- Removed the unused `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions` dependency from `CQRSharp.Abstractions`
  (the `netstandard2.0` build now references `Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces` directly).

### Added

- `IRetryableRequest` opt-in marker for automatic retries.
- `Command`/`Query`/`Stream` `Failed` lifecycle notifications, published when a handler faults.
- First-class dispatcher configuration via `AddCqrs(..., configureDispatcher)` / `AddCqrsGenerated(..., configureDispatcher)`.
- Public `CqrsPipelinePriorities` constants for ordering custom behaviors relative to the built-ins.
- Start-up options validation (`ValidateOnStart`) for the background queue, outbox, timeout, and resilience options.
- Durable outbox retry/back-off with dead-lettering driven by a persisted attempt count.

### Fixed

- Release/NuGet publish workflow now triggers on the `Release` branch (previously a non-existent `main`).
- Background queue no longer drops a dequeued task on shutdown (which left awaiting callers hung forever).
- Notification pump no longer leaks a semaphore permit on the no-dispatcher path (which could deadlock the pump).
- Resilience behavior runs outside the unit of work, so each retry executes against a fresh transaction.
- Notification fan-out surfaces every handler failure (not just the first) and isolates synchronously-throwing handlers.
- Token-bucket rate limiter refills continuously rather than only in whole-second chunks, with torn-read-safe access.
- Unit-of-work rollback failures no longer mask the original error.
